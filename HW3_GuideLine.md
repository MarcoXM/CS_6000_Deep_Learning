# CS6000 Deep Learning - HW3 


## What the students can learn from this HW?


Problem : Multilabels/Multiclassification Problem

* Understand The difficulty in how to **TRAINING RNN NETWORK**
* gradient **explosiong and gradient dissapearance.**
* How to deal with the seq data in **batch** !


## Advantages
* Possibility of processing input of any length
* Model size not increasing with size of input
* Computation takes into account historical information
* Weights are shared across time

## Disadvantages
* Computation being slow
* Difficulty of accessing information from a long time ago
* Cannot consider any future input for the current state

不能coding体现的问题点就用问答题来体现出来！



##  Problems
